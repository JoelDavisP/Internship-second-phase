I had a hospital case on yesterday, my grandmother was not well and hospitalised from thursday evening and I had to go there on yesterday.

Today I restarted javascript project.  Completed basic functionalities and trying to implement shapes functionalities.

There are some issues in the shapes, so I will do it later after refering some other projects.

Meanwhile, I installed Django software after creating a new test environment and started learning Django in free time.

Installation process is over, now from tomorrow I will start some mini projects in Django in free time.

And I will start the web browser project from tomorrow.

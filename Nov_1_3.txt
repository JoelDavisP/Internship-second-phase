Continuing Javascript tutorials.

Initially I found a lot of troubles while experimenting on te exercises of Eloquent javascript.


Some examples given were not working as I expected and I couldn't resolve the issues.


Later I found 'w3schools' website for javascript tutorials.


I felt it is much better than the above text and now practicing exercises given.

Minor differences between both, but now getting more confident while trying these examples.


Will resume Eloquent JS after finishing these exercises.

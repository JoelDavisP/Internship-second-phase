Trying the tasks given.

Completed first two days task (unit testing and refactoring).

It's a nice experience and knowledge, even though it took some time to grasp.

Today started the next task, studying the modules in python.

Tenth chapter was not at all tough since I used most of the modules and methods in the previous sessions.

So, after finishing it I continued ed. x course week1.

I completed all videos and one word qns, then moved on to exercises..

First three were not too much hard, but later it became tough to understand the qn itself.

I read qn many times, asked doubt but still not getting what it means.

I have to say that the explanations were so poor, or may be tough.

The wordings were not enough to understand what the requirements were.

So, I switched to interview cake lectures.

It explains everything in a nice and elegant way.

I completed all three lectures, but the remaining parts were paid, so I had to stop it there. 

Now continuing the ed.x course and will resume task3 tomorrow.

Continuing python practice book exercises.

Completed 5th chapter and reached half of the last chapter.

Last chapter is about recursion and functional programming.

Recursion seems to be a little bit challenging for me.

Completed 5 problems, but it took so much time to get the correct logic behind every recursive programs.

Its a time consuming task and try to complete it in this week itself.

Tomorrow I have to go to my college for bringing my last two sem certificates.

I will go there after attending the class, so I may not be able to work tomorrow.

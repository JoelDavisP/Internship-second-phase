Getting well from the sick.

Today I started task 3 and finished 9th chapter in dive into python book.

Little bit tough at the beginning, then last sessions could complete by myself.

Took some more time in the starting.


I read the first section in the algorithm book by Interview cake, read a few problems.


Then the ed.x course started today at 3 P.M. 

I was excited in the ed.x course, and had lot of expectations from the previous ed.x course.


Completed first two videos, but I was not at all satisfied with the lectures.

Some issues with the style of speaking, and also the contetnts in first two were not upto the mark.

May be it will be OK in the remaining classes..

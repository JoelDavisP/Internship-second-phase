After a few days gap due to some hardware problems in my system, back into action yesterday.

Due to some internal errors, I had to re-install ubuntu and hence to intall some softwares and update system.

Restarted the works.

Completed the questions in advent of code of these days.

Added the web server program (except images) to my repo.


Still working to find out the issues with images, but not getting the correct solution.

Trying different ways of solutions for the images.

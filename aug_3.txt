Two days inevitable break came to an end.

Those days were really helpful to refresh mind.

Restatred the working process, or in 'pythonic way', 'yielded' the session from where I stopped last.

Started the Hand problem in object oriented style (ed.x week 5).

Downloaded all week2 learning materials of NPTEL course and restarted the   algorithm learning session.

Work just a few hours due to some health issues, but will bounce back tomorrow.

Started the web server project.

Practiced some basic networking examples in python.

Studying more about the sockets and fork system calls.

Creating sockets seems to be simple but synchronization is the major problem in all kinds of networking exercises.

Searched some web pages to get more idea about web servers and its working.

Got the basic idea on how to implement the web server.

Yesterday, after the class I had to go to my college for bringing my final year certificates.

I reached home late, so I couldn't do anything.

Today, I continued from where I left the last day.

Doing the exercises in Python Practice book.

Almost finished the last chapter.

Only two exercises in recursion are remaining in the last chapter, which I will try to complete tomorrow itself.

Read the next set of tasks and will try to start it as soon as possible.

I will try to take a little more effort from the next week.

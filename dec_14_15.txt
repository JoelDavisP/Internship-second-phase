Completed first 15 video tutorials of django.

Working out videos in vim seems to be a little difficult for me; Finding locations of different files in the project make some confusions.

From today, I started preparing half of the time for the final interview in U.S.T. global, until next week.

So I could work Django project in half of the time.

Blog post created in Django project is added to Git.

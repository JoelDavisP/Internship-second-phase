Completed all the problems in chapter 2 in python practice book, except one problem about finding type of file, from word frequency. 

I didnt understand how to find type of file from word frequency.

Then started chapter 3 and finished first three problems.

Today my cousin brother had an accident and a minor surgery at Thrissur Mission hospital.

So I had to go there to do some helps for them. Also I had to drive back and forth a few times. So I couldnt do anything today.

A few more related works to complete, and hope to resume doing task 2 from tomorrow noon.

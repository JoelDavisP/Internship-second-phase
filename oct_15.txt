Not a good day.

I think due to some climate changes in these two days, I caught cold and fever.

Not able to work continuously.

Anyways, I completed all the remaining practice book problems, so task 2 is comlpeted.

Will start the next set of task tomorrow itself.

Also reading 'The Intutive Guide to D.S.A' in free times.


New ed.x course will start tomorrow.

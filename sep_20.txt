Almost a bad day.

Today I again tried to download the recent class's video, but failed for fifth time.

Then I stopped trying instead I created my own dropbox account.


At last I succeded..

In the first 1 and a half hour, I watched that video very well.

Then I saw Pamode sir's videos of recursion and reflection..

I completed all the tasks in recursion 

After evening I felt not well, so I stopped watching more videos.

From tomorrow onwards I have to start Javascript studying.

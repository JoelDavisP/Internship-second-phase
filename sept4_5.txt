First of all Onam wishes and Happy Teachers day to all my teachers..

Yesterday, there was no time to study.

Some celebrations and functions at home..

Today I got some hours for studying..

Split the total time  into two parts..

In the first part I watched two video tutorials regarding generators and decorators in python..

Little bit trickier part but it's extremely useful in big data..

Have to work out the exercises on tomorrow.

Second half is used to study SICP text..

But it's a complicated task..


I found some difficulties while programming in scheme.

Some exercises were totally time-killing, and still I didnt find the answers..

Anyways I'll try more on this topic.

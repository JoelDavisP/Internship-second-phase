Studying Javascript concepts.

Completed three more  chapters of that book.

I had to repeatedly read some parts to get more clarity.

Some parts like functions as values, are little confusing for me.


Trying to understand all concepts clearly.


Working out most of the exercises and trying to start the paint application as soon as possible, after completing all chapters.

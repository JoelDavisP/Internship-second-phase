One single problem.
All I did today, was a single problem, implementation of Hangman game.
The problem was not at all a big one, but still I took some hours to complete it..
At first, I made some basic level mistakes and that lead to big headache, at the end.
I had to rebuild it completely, for getting a solution.
And finally I got the desired output.
The major thing I studied today, was in how many different ways I can make mistakes and also recover from that.
Not a bad lesson, I think!!
So today, I made my first game in python succesfully.
Little bit excited, so I spend almost one hour for playing my first hand made game
Important thing is, for the first time, I was solving my mistakes and recorrecting it until I got the last answer. Usually I quit the task and go to the next question.
It gave me some sort of confidence.

And that also brought an end to the week 3 session of ed.x course.

Also I watched one video tutorial of Pramode sir and installed Go software for next week's workshop.

And thats the emd of this day,
I'll start next week tuts on tmrw.

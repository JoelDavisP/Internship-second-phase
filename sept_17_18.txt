Yesterday I tried out some more exercises in the generator session.

I tried out all the exercises in generator using class, mentioned in the videos.

I started some exercises in python practice book which were a little bit complicated and need more time to complete it.

Now studying the O.S. module in python..


Today, I attended the first online class but couldnt complete it due to power failures.

There was no power supply till noon, and after that I got an interview call on tomorrow and so I started the preparation for the interview. Refreshing some previous ideas introduced in earlier sessions.

And I've to attend the interview, so I wont able to do anything on tomorrow.

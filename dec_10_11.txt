Almost finished the given Django study materials in this two days.

Last chapter will finish soon.


The book was amazing and really useful for a beginner in django.

I got the work flow and different processes in django web development.

Need more practice to remember whatever done so far.

Also created an account in pythonanywhere.com and added my code into it.

These two days were totally spent for the project in Javascript.


Completed the basic operations.

Need to complete some other operations also, and to study the destructuring part more.

It was little bit tough for me to identify where the errors were and what was the error.

Some errors were my mistakes and some due to the lack of proper understanding of the language.

Read some documents about the drawbacks of the language and some errors were only identified after reading those documents.

My colleagues helped me a lot to clarify the mistakes; That part is helpful for me, because they also made some of those mistake and corrected it. So I could correct it easily.


Need to complete the remaining part as early as possible and start the second part soon.

It might be an easier task if I spend little more time to study the languageproperly, nevertheless I studied language more through this project.

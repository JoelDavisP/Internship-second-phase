Last day I went for an interview in SHREDS for the first and last time..

It not only wasted my entire day, but also made me sick..

Today I was not at all 100% healthy..

However I managed to study 3 video tutorials provided by sir.

Memory management in python which was a little bit complicated one..

I understood the basic ideas, but not the entire things like what happened in case of cyclic referencing and similar things..

I dont know how to really understand such things.

Anyways the sessions were brilliant

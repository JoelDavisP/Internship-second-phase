These days spend most of the time in reading and solving problems in the first week of ed.x course 2.

Questions were tough to understand, but still interesting to do.

I have to say that I lost my few hours to understand the question properly, but still it was a good experience.

Completed all the examples except two, as they were really tough to understand and experiment, so I skipped it.

Today I started third task in task3.

Reading and working out the exercises in pythonista site.

Most of the exercises were already done in some previous classes.

But still I worked out every exercises from the start and reached upto 37.

I think, it wont be enough, just trying out these exercises.

Instead I've to do a lot more practice questions in these topic(Modules also).

I will try the remaining part tomorrow.

Some sample questions to try out will be extremely helpful, otherwise it might be forgotten soon.

Without practicing some questions, these session were not at all useful, and I will try to find some practice questions in the next two days.

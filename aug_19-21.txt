I have to attend a marriage function on the first two days, so there was no time left for working..

Today there was no electricity from 10 to 5. So I just refreshed some previous lessons and have some doubts at some parts.

Will clear after Pramode sir reached from Bangalore.

Watched two more videos provided by Pramode sir, It's a little bit tricky.

Downloaded all NPTEL tuts and pdfs..

Now concentrating more on python, algorithms will seen later..

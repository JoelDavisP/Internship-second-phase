I think today I had the best lecture in the ed.x course.

Yes, week 4 tutorials were the best and the most important session in this course.

It's all about mistakes and exceptions and how to handle bugs when it arrives..

Very useful for me, because I occasionally makes simple and complicated mistakes.

Almost reached at the end of week 4 tutorials.

Watched one more video of Pramode sir.

I spent These two days for mostly studying Javascript.

Almost got an idea about how to write codes in Javascript.

Then I tried some exercises given in that tutorials, due to lack of time I stopped from 4th chapter and started implementing the Scheme compiler in Javascript.


I completed first two parts, i.e. Tokenization as well as Parsing in Javascript.

I asked some helps from my colleagues and they taught me some specific things in the procedure. 

I also completed two tutorials videos and reading the Pythonista material now.

There was a one hour session in today morning and I attended the session..

Today I was experimenting on generator expressions.

In the morning attended a few minutes class.

Then watched the generator expression videos once again and tried all the exercises mentioned in the session using generator objects.

Added every programs tried today into git repo.

Tried to understand Lispy more and understood most of the code.

Tried with different examples provided by the webpage..

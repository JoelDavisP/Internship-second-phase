I was completing the pythonista part.

Read all things in that site, and practiced it.

Completed week 1 in the ed. x course and I started another free online course in introduction to python and python in data analysis.

It is a practical oriented course.

Some five minutes long practice sessions and then exercises regarding the session.

First course was introduction to python and data analysis tools in python.

It's completed in these two days.


Second one is learning more about data analysis using python tools.

Now I'm continuing that course.

It's really helpful for me.

I'm doing it after completing each days specific task.

I already read pythonista materials before sir mentioned it as a task, so I had some time in these two days.

From tomorrow, second week of ed.x will start, and I will try to resume this course in between free times

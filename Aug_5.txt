Started week 6 of ed.x course and completed helf of the tutorials.

It is similar to the NPTEL week 2 module and I felt this tutorials part will be more helpful than NPTEL class.

So I paused NPTEL tutorials for a while.

I will restart it after finishing week 6 of ed.x; I think it will be more helpful for me

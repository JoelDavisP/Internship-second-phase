Today I attended GO language basic workshop.

Not a bad one, but I was not at all too satisfied with the teaching style;
may be due to the continuous lectures from MIT tutors in ed.x course, I felt this class was an average one.

Reached home late and I was tired, so no further action on ed.x course

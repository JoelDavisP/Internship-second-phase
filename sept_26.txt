Completed the first part of project in javascript.

Took some additional time when I tried to rebuild some functions after some modifications.

Spend too much time than I expected to complete the basic things.

A bit tired, so Changed the topic and watched the video of the last online class and tried out the exercise in that video.

Later tried to code the second part, but got confused at some OO concepts in JS.

Then tried to implement it in another way, without using OO behaviour and use only functional and imperative style.

Tomorrow I have to go to Thrissur to apply for Degree certificate.

And will try it after returning from there.

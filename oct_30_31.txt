Learning and practising javascript web application programs.

Installed sublime text editor and trying out example programs in it.

Still some parts in web application is confusing for me, and I could not understand some sections in the code.

I asked some support from my colleagues doing this assignment.

Meanwhile I watched all videos in week 3 in the ed.x course "How to win programming competition" and completed associated simple problems.


Programming assignment will be done after completing this project.


Now working with the given Javascript task.

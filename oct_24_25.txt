these two days I completed task 3.

Also Completed watching videos of the ed.x course 2 as well as one word quesstions.

At present I was doing the programming questions in the ed. x course.

I read the new task and the additional materials in html5.

I'm not at all comfortable with JS, but I will try to do this task.

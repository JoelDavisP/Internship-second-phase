Sorry for the delayed update..

These days I was trying the second part of project and completing multithread video tutorials.

I finished the multithread videos section yesterday and just started multitasking videos.

It was really a great exposure to the multithreading part.

I could understand those chapters well; more than I learned in B.Tech syllabus.

I tried out almost all exercises in the videos and found to know how difficult those sections were.

In the project section, I hadn't got the correct logic of the second part of project  till I read my colleague's program.

After reading those sections carefully, I tried to implement it myself, still I got some errors, and tried to recorrect those errors.

And finally I could get a proper code that implements a Lisp compiler in Javascript..

I am trying a few more functions now and have to add proper comments in the code.

Will try to complete this in a few days and also complete the remaining two videos in the tutorials section.

Yesterday I completed reading the necessary parts of Javascript in the site w3schools.com.

And after reading this, I got an idea how to proceed further in the project.

In the last couple of days I was repeatedly reading the eloquent Javascript but couldnt understand more.

I tried to read some tutorials and even videos of this text book, but there were no use at all.

But after completing this tutorials part in w3schools, when I read from the chapter of canvas in eloquent javascript, I could get a more clear idea.

I have to say that, the book was not a beginner level, an intermediate level for me.

Now I got a better idea than the previous one.


From tomorrow itself I will start the main project, paint application and try to finish it as early as possible.


Sorry for the bad delay, but I was trying in all these days, might not be upto the mark.


And I will try more better than this from tomorrow.

Attending MIT classes of introduction to python..
Ideas are quite interesting and need more time to finish it..
I feel it would be better to complete it, but it also depends on time..
Exercises are little bit trickier, but still I could find our the solutions..
Trying to work at least 7 to 8 hours per day.

Day for doing some exercises and practice problems.

In the first half section I tried out some exercises on generator objects and iterator in Python Practice book.


While doing it, I got some confusions on python modules, so I started doing exercises in different python modules, especially OS module in python.

Did some exercises in os module.

In the second half, I tried to study a material provided by sir regarding MIT scheme. 

Studied some basic stuffs, but not at all comfortable with functional programming style

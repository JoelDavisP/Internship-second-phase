Experimenting with the second part of project a little time.

Not getting a proper way to implement it.

So I switched temporarily from Javascript to Python.

Continued with the video tutorials especially regarding Multithreading concepts.


After studying it, I found an interesting fact.

In B.tech syllabus I was just blindly mug up things for university exams without understandinng how things actually works.


I could remember all the terms mentioned in Oct_29th class, and now I could relate everything in a poper way.

It's a crucial fact about 4 years B.tech life.

I think more such sessions will be really worthy and usefull for me.

Watched 3 videos on multithreading yesterday.


Today, I have to do some works in home so, I couldnt do much.
